The First BRC20 Metaverse Dango Released the First BRC20 Token $DGOO Gains Wide Attention


Dango is the first Web3 metaverse project driven by the Dango DAO in the BRC-20 ecosystem. Its name is derived from the Japanese word "Dango," and its core values are democracy, unity, and sharing. Dango plans to establish a country (Planet) based on the utopian concept, and the DGOO token issued on BTC will serve as the sole legal currency of Dango Planet. In the future, Dango will release BTC-exclusive limited edition NFTs on BRC-20, and users holding DGOO will have priority opportunities to obtain them. Every NFT holder will be a citizen of Dango Planet. 

Overview:
On a mysterious planet located at the edge of the distant galaxy, there exists a species of creatures called "Dango," which have remained unknown to human beings. The Dango have been guarding a legendary treasure for generations, but only the "royal family" knows the truth about the treasure's existence. According to legend, whoever finds the treasure will gain the royal family's wealth.

Due to the existence of the treasure, many outsiders have appeared on the Dango planet, but they have no signs of life. However, they have the same appearance as the Dango. In the human world, these outsiders are called "AI intelligences." The Dango have been guarding the planet and the treasure for generations, but since the arrival of the "outsiders," the planet has been riddled with holes, possibly dug by the outsiders in search of the treasure.

The Dango king holds supreme power, but in order to maintain the planet's prosperity and to protect the people from being oppressed by the outsiders, an assembly was established in the year 1063 of the "Dango Calendar." The six legendary knights, each possessing one of six different superpowers and holding one of six clues leading to the location of the treasure, protect the king and the assembly.

It was thought that the Dango and outsiders were coexisting on the planet under some unspoken agreement...until one of the six knights suddenly disappeared, and a loud noise was heard from the "uninhabited forest" on the other side of the planet.

Updates
Recently, the DGOO token has gained widespread attention on the BRC-20 network. In just two days, 210 million DGOO tokens were minted, breaking ORDI's record with a daily minting volume of 100 million tokens. As of now, DGOO tokens have risen more than 25 times in price, and trading volume and market capitalization continue to grow.

Before the launch of DGOO, the Dango team released the first batch of Dango NFT on the Sui Network, which quickly gained 22,000 Twitter followers and 20,000 community members. The cryptocurrency community on Twitter has also started discussing the trading volume of DGOO tokens, which even briefly ranked second on the Uniswap in-progress leaderboard.

As the first Web3 metaverse project based on the BRC-20 network, Dango combines ERC-20 gameplay with decentralized features of BRC-20. The team has also announced plans to build the Dango Planet ecosystem, launch a new NFT project on the BRC-20 network, and establish a complete BRC-20 community ecosystem.

After missing out on the ORDI hype, Dango's emergence has shown people the greater potential of BRC-20 and could become the next big thing. As a result,many investors are now focusing on this opportunity.
